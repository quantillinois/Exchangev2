Make exchange to send orders for TPC
Need python script to verify order is valid.
Make c++ script for serialization (see python script)

Client sends order that looks like this:


Example TPCF
O,MPID_A    ,TPCF1010,B,75,10,ORDERID001

order_type: 1 byte
mpid: 10 bytes
ticker: 8 bytes
side: 1 byte
price: 4 bytes
size: 4 bytes
orderid: 10 bytes


2/13:
- Need to send order outbound OUCH
- Need to detect wash trades
- Need to refactor TickerConfiguration and orderclass.py

Ports:
2000 - Bot to GW
7000 - Generator
8000 - GW to OME (Server)
9000 - OME to GW (Publisher) <- honestly idk if this can be done through server or if publisher is the right move
10000 - Market Feed from OME (Publisher)
