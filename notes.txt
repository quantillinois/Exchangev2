Make exchange to send orders for TPC
Need python script to verify order is valid.
Make c++ script for serialization (see python script)
Need to prevent wash trades (trading with oneself)
ITCH check which orders are yours for client
For market orders, make sure to not reveal the underlying limit order(s) ie. market = limit order buy @ max price, but shouldn't show accepted at max price, just trade?
Grab full orderbook from tickerplant if needed.
Make it so that gateway knows which mpid for which port in advance through config file
Make dataclass's default value and then go in and delete all the weird struct inits

Client sends order that looks like this:


Example TPCF
O,MPID_A    ,TPCF1010,B,75,10,ORDERID001

order_type: 1 byte
mpid: 10 bytes
ticker: 8 bytes
side: 1 byte
price: 4 bytes
size: 4 bytes
orderid: 10 bytes


2/13:
- Need to send order outbound OUCH
- Need to detect wash trades
- Need to refactor TickerConfiguration and orderclass.py

Ports:
2000 - Bot to GW
7000 - Generator
8000 - GW to OME (Server)
9000 - OME to GW (Publisher) <- honestly idk if this can be done through server or if publisher is the right move
10000 - Market Feed from OME (Publisher)
11000 - Tickerplant to Bot/Client
